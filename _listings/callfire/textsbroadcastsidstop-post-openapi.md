        seven system safeguards that check the accuracy and consistency of the data.
        For example, our system checks that contact number is formatted correctly,
        is valid, is not duplicated in another contact list, or is not added on a
        specific DNC list. You can configure to keep/merge or remove contacts which
        do not complies these rules. If contacts were not added to a contact list
        after the validation, this means the data needs to be properly formatted and
